        <h1>- About Me -</h1>
    <p>
        My interest in computer programming and software development begin while I was employed with Choctaw Casino and Resort. My position there required me to use analytical skill and critical thinking for in house and outhouse marketing.  I worked with the computer programmers and software developers for the company and l discovered I had a high aptitude for understanding the processes of creating application.""When contract ended, I accepted a position with Aviation Power Support.  There I continued to utilize my technical abilities to be successful in that position.  I started out as a blender, and within two years i was promoted to quality control inspector. However, I reached a plato and decided to take a computer programming cohort to develop my computer skills and create a better future for myself.  After graduating from the cohort, I searched for positions that coincide my goals and mission in life and that is what lead me to apply for this position. My ability to break down information and take apart technical problems would be the strongest trait about me.
